- Longer forward reads (51bp) than reverse reads (35bp)

- No issue of sequence quality
- We have an expected biased fragmentation, especially strong in reverse reads which is expected in RNAseq.
- Weird distributions in Reverse GC content with a scale stuff, might be due to the contamination with adapters
- No N sequences, fine read length
- Small duplication levels, expected for RNA-seq
- No adapters content
- Small overepresented GGGGGGGGGGGG reads in reverse librairies which is due to insufficient DNA output
